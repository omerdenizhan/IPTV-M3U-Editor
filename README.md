4. Select channels and click **Check** to test only those channels.
5. Use **Sort** to sort channels A-Z or by status.

cd awesome-m3u-editor

## Privacy

Awesome M3U Editor works locally in your browser. Your playlist is not sent to a server.

## Notes about status checking

Browser-based checking has limits. Some IPTV servers block browser status checks with CORS. When that happens, the app shows `CORS` instead of guessing whether the stream is alive or dead.
